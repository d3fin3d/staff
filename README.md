## Moderation

### General

* __No tablet/mobile moderation__

  Never moderate from a phone/tablet device. Not only are infractions issued incorrectly when using a mobile device,
but general moderation is trickier and errors far more frequent. Only moderate from a desktop or laptop computer.

### Tools

* __Locking__

  Threads should be locked if the thread itself is redundant or irrelevant. EG: repeated suggestions, content
that could be posted within pinned threads or topics that have been bumped and are no longer relevant. Unless a
thread is a couple of topic pages buried, or is old, you should always leave a lock message.

* __Moving__

  Always make sure that "Leave a link to the new topic in the source forum?" is checked when moving a thread to
a different category. This ensures members can easily find their post.

* __Editing__

  Leaving a public edit message within "legal" posts is fine. This includes when fixing formatting, adding spoiler
  tags, etc. However, publically editing rule breaking posts can leave the poster humiliated and demoralised. To
  avoid this, ensure that you leave "Edited By" unchecked and that you don't publically brand the rule breaking
  post as edited in any way. If you're editing out a rule break and the post needs to be infracted, make sure that
  you infract the post before making the edit - that way you'll store the original post within the infraction details.

* __Hiding__

  If a thread is breaking a rule, it should be hidden. Hidden threads should almost always be infracted/informalled.
Feel free to ask an admin if you are unsure whether to hide/infract a post.

* __Infracting__

  Members with no previous infractions/informals should always receive an informal warning unless their first
rule break is worth 2 points or more.

### Specific

* __Check infraction history and don't stack informal warnings__

  Before issuing an informal/infraction, you should always check a members infraction history. If a member has 1
or more prior informals, it's time to give them a formal infraction. Informals exist both to remind members of the
rules and to informally warn for light rule breaks. Piling up informals suggests that it's possible to continue
breaking the rules without consequence.

* __Dealing with profanity__

  If a post contains profanity, acronyms included, the word(s) should be edited out. If the profanity coincides 
with any flaming or other rule breaking, please remove the post and infract as normal.

* __Misplaced server threads should be hidden__

  If a server thread is posted outside of the PC servers section, do not move it into servers. Hide the thread and
infract for "Server thread (wrong section)". If it's a first offense, informal.

* __Do not move threads into "Minecraft Server Hosting"__

  Minecraft server host threads are carefully vetted before being moved into the "Minecraft Server Hosting" section.
As such, do not move hosting threads into this category. If the thread is not a duplicate, move it to "Other Hosts".

## Sectional Moderation

### Minecraft Discussion

* __Server Threads__

  Hide and infract users for advertising server threads outside of the server section.  If the user is reletevely
new (i.e < 10 posts) and has never recieved an infraction before, you can just give an informal; otherwise give
a full infraction.  However, if a user has made a thread looking to join a server, move that thread to the Looking
For section.
 
* __Redundant Suggestions__

  Lock and provide a link to the previous topic in the lock message.  Utilize the "Common Suggestions" thread
that is pinned in the Suggestion section to find the links.

* __Video Replies in News Section__

  Per Sacheverell's request, please remove all video replies to News section threads

### Mapping and Modding

* __Images and Videos__

  If a topic does not have images or videos embedded, but does have them linked in the topic, edit the post and embed them for them.
  If a topic does not have images or videos at all, then informal them reminding them of that, and leave the topic for them to fix. 
  If they do not have it fixed within a day or two, hide the topic.
  
* __Mod / Mod devs clashes__

  If 2 or more mods or mod makers are clashing/arguing with each other, contact the Forum Admin and inform him of it.
  Such situations usually require the admin to get involved to have it resolved.
  
* __Exe files__

  Exe only downloads are not allowed except in the Tools section. If there are any exe only downloads, remove the topic and informal the user.
  Exes are also the most common way to distribute malware, so be sure to get those files scanned. 

* __Malware and Scans__

  If you come across a suspicious file, please get it scanned. 
  If you need to hide the topic for a little bit to avoid users from running it, please do.
  The most common scan sites we use are [Virustotal](http://virustotal.com) and [Anubis](http://anubis.iseclab.org/).
  Malware is a perm-ban and should be reported in #forum using the [Pinging an admin](#pinging-an-admin) template for malware.
  Lastlogin stealers and backdoor plugin or mods are not a perm-ban on the first offense, so use the Malware warn template.
  On the second offense, follow the [Pinging an admin](#pinging-an-admin) Malware template to have the account banned.
  
* __Mod Sites__
 
  Sites that redistribute mods, whether by rehosting the files or by linking the original topic or download links, are not allowed.
  Such sites are not permitted and should be warned for advertising.

### MCX360, MCPE and Other Platforms

* __Lock "When's the new update?" threads__

  Any threads regarding when updates are coming out should be locked for redundancy. Feel free to add a link to the
appropriate pinned thread.

* __Forward on messages from Mojang/Microsoft/4J Studios__

  Do not reply to any messages you receive from parties involved with Minecraft such as Mojang, Microsoft or 4J Studios.
Add citricsquid to the conversation instead allowing him to deal with it in an appropriate manner.

* __Suggestion sections__

  - **Wishlists**

  Members who post suggestion threads with the sole purpose of gathering ideas and suggestions from other members
should have their threads locked for encouraging wishlisting.

  *Example lock message:*
  
  "Please do not post more than one suggestion per thread. Very closely related suggestions are fine, but separate
suggestions require separate threads. Wishlists will be closed or deleted."

  - **Small suggestions**

  Suggestions that are very small and don't require a brand new thread should be locked and pointed to the respective
[Xbox 360 small suggestions thread](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1690852-) or
[Pocket Edition small suggestions thread](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1690834-).

  *Example lock message:*
  
  "If your suggestion is a small one, please use the 
[Small Xbox 360 Edition Suggestions thread](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1690852-)."

  - **Vague suggestions**

  Similarly, topics which are vague, lacking detail and offer little to no discussion should be locked. Again,
if the idea is small one, please link to the appropriate small suggestions thread.

  *Example lock message:*
  
  "Please ensure your suggestions are clear, concise and fleshed out. Topics which are vague and/or lacking detail
will be locked. If your suggestion is a small one, please use the 
[Small Suggestions thread](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/654104-)."

  - **Redundancy**

  If a suggestion/idea covers exactly the same subject as a previous suggestion thread - and isn't significantly
different in detail - please lock the thread and reply with both the lock reason and a
[link to an existing relevant, active topic](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1665843-).

  *Example lock message:*
  
  "This idea has been suggested before [here]. Please do not post redundant threads. Always browse the current threads
in the forum and use the forums "Search" function at the top of the page before posting. Replying to older threads to
continue discussion and share ideas is acceptable."

* __Multiplayer sections__

  - **Misplaced server, session and minigame threads**
  
  If a server, session or mini-game thread is posted outside of the Multiplayer section, please remove the thread
and, if it's a first offense, informal with the reason: "server thread wrong section". If it's their second, go
ahead and formally warn.

  - **Misplaced "Looking For / Build Help" and clan threads**

  If a "Looking For / Build Help" or clan thread is posted outside of the Multiplayer section, providing the thread
is not a duplicate, move the thread to the appropriate Multiplayer section.

  - **Misplaced threads within the Multiplayer section**

  If a server, session or mini-game thread is posted in the wrong section within the Multiplayer section, move it
to the right category. If the thread is a duplicate, hide as normal.

* __Xbox 360: modification threads__

  Threads regarding the modification of Xbox 360 whether they be map downloads, tools for modification etc.
should be hidden and result in a one point infraction (Informal on first offence) given to the offending user.
Please use the infraction reason: "Modification (MCX360)".

* __Xbox 360: glitching is not allowed__

  Any threads detailing how to perform any duplication glitches within Minecraft: Xbox Edition should be hidden
and the user should receive an informal infraction notifying them that such posts aren't accepted.

* __Xbox 360: Help and Support__

  Please move the following threads to the Xbox 360
[Help and Support section](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forum/230-mcx360-help-support/):
  - Interface issues
  - Technical questions
  - Video recording questions

  The exception to this rule is bug report threads. These, if confirmed, should generally be locked and pointed to
the [Known bugs list thread](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1679404-) as normal.

* __Xbox 360: Seeds__

  To avoid many, many locked/removed seeds threads within the Xbox 360 seeds sections, moderators are permitted to
add the title update version tag. eg: [TU8], to the titles of threads that have are missing the title formatting.

  Please be sure you're confident about the version the members seed thread is related to.

* __Pocket Edition: Mapping and Modding__

  The [root of Mapping and Modding](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forum/229-mcpe-mapping-and-modding/) is free for all
MCPE: M&M threads which don't fit into either the maps, texture packs or mods / tools sections.

  Examples of threads that can exist in the MCPE M&M root:
  - Mod/tools discussion / creation / support threads.
  - Texture pack discussion / creation / support threads.
  - Map discussion discussion / creation / support threads.
  - MCPE M&M related tutorials.
  - Anything else MCPE M&M related that isn't specifically a mod, tool, texture pack or map.

  Exceptions:

  Compliment threads referring to an existing M&M thread in one of the sub-sections should be locked and pointed to
the original mod/tool/map/texture pack thread.

* __Pocket Edition: Texture packs require the authors permission__

  Threads posted within the MCPE: Texture Packs section must include permission from the original artist if
porting a PC texture pack created by another user. If a member does not have permission you should give the user
an infraction for "Stolen Content (MCPE)".

## Etiquette

As a Minecraft Forum staff member it's important to note that, besides helping to keep things running
smoothly, there are some fundamental points of etiquette that need to be followed:

* __Never leak information__

  All communication within staff IRC channels, the Administrator & Moderator section, Apparatus, infraction PM's
and all other staff orientated interaction is considered private and confidential. Do not, under any
circumstances, divulge any of this material to anyone beyond the staff group.

* __Don't break the rules__

  As a staff member, you are governed by exactly the same set of rules as everyone else. You are expected to
follow the rules very closely, setting a good example to other members. This includes ensuring all your content
and replies are suitable for a family friendly environment.

* __Contain the IRC/A&M madness__

  There's a lot of frivolous fun and mayhem within the staff group. Many staff members use these areas to let
their proverbial hair down and go wild. It's important to remember that this craziness shouldn't extend beyond
the boundaries of the inner staff walls. Keep your public persona sane and on point.

* __Be polite and courteous__

  You are a representative of MCF. Please bear this in mind when engaging with other members. A few basic
pleasantries can go a long, long way. Make sure that you include "please" and "thank you" in the appropriate
places and remain polite at all times. However, check that you're not being overly nice or smiley in the wrong
places, as this could be interpreted as sarcasm, ridicule or arrogance.

* __Don't abuse or brag about your position__

  Please use the tools you have been given wisely. If you disagree with an opinion or dislike posted material that
is fully within the MCF rules, do not edit it out or hide the post. Moderative action for personal gain is
strictly forbidden. Never use your position as leverage over other members. Being part of the Minecraft Forum
staff can be exciting, but please don't go out of your way to brag about it.

* __Avoid argumentative behaviour__

  Participating in heated debates while carrying the staff tag can feel threatening and unfair to other members
of the forum. While logged in as staff, please avoid conflicts, confrontation and expressing aggressive opinions.
If you really want to passionately discuss something, please use an alternate account.

* __Personal opinion is not always fact__

  Within all your content, always check that you're not stating an opinion as fact. What you write can be viewed
as gospel by the rest of the forum. If you're expressing an opinion, please use: "I believe", "personally" and
"in my opinion". Make sure that, unless 100% certain, you're not stating a personal belief as the whole truth.
If ever in doubt, always ask before making "official" sounding statements.

* __Moderate objectively__

  You should never moderate content that you are directly affiliated with. This includes: Your own topics, threads
of servers that you admin/moderate/help out with, infraction disputes and replies to your posts. If there's any
hint of a conflict of interest, please either report the rule break or refer the task to a fellow staff member.

* __Don't flame Mojang__

  Mojang are the reason we're here. They publically consider minecraftforum.net the "official" forums and have
given us, an external website, the responsibility of being the primary location for all Minecraft related
discussion. Therefore, by association, your position will be considered affiliated with Mojang. As such, do not
flame Mojang, their employees, their products or their actions. Feel free to offer your balanced opinion, but
if you feel a burning desire to express criticism, contempt or insult towards Mojang, please use an account
that's not connected to the MCF staff group.

* __Behave well everywhere else too__

  Your Minecraft Forum details will probably connect to other accounts, websites and in-game names around the
interweb. Please take this into consideration when conducting yourself online. Your MCF representation extends
to all other environments that share the same details. If you wish to be riské elsewhere, use an alias or
alternate account.


Please ensure that everything you do fits within these etiquette guidelines. We take staff misbehaviour very
seriously, especially considering the public representative position that staff members have been given.

## Apparatus

A number of things to keep in mind when voting and commenting on moderator applications, as these really help us
out when deciding on potential new staff members.

* __Voting__

  Voting no means you think they would not make a good moderator in any section. If you think they would be a good
candidate but for a section other than your own, please vote yes and explain that in the comments.

* __Commenting__

  If you vote yes or no, please explain your reasons in the comments. Sometimes it's blindingly obvious of course,
but it isn't always. You might know more than others about a certain user. We want to know the reasons you think
they'd be a good or bad moderator, otherwise your vote doesn't tell us much other than your personal opinion

* __Posting is not activity__

  Just because a member does not post on a regular basis does not mean that they don't log in. If a user isn't
posting often, they may be regulating their own post quality. Remember, we want quality over quantity. I'd rather
a user didn't post than posted crap on every thread they visit.

* __Lacking posts in certain sections__

  A user doesn't necessarily have to post in the sections they are applying for. Just because they don't post in
the section does not mean that they don't visit often. They may not have their own original content/ideas for
the section, or may feel they do not need to add to discussion. This isn't to say that they do not enjoy browsing
the section and consuming the content.

* __Post count__

  Post count means absolutely nothing. If a member has 5 extremely helpful posts, it's far better than a member
with 500 useless posts.

* __Don't just go with the crowd__

  Take your time to read through each application and make your own decision. Don't just vote as other's are voting.
Don't feel you need to vote the same way as others, but explain the reasons why you agree or disagree with others.

* __Don't compare users__

  Don't compare apps as though we have a limit. If someone would make a good moderator we should hire them
regardless. "I've seen better" is not a valid reason to deny someone the moderator position. We aren't hiring for
just one moderator, we need lots. If we used this reason, we'd only have one moderator.

* __You can skip applications!__

  If you aren't sure simply don't vote. Don't feel you have to vote if you are undecided.

* __Don't obsess over small issues__

  Things like "they put more effort into this part of the application than this part which I find more important"
is not a reason to vote no. You should be considering the member as a whole, not just voting no because he did one
little thing you don't like.

* __Take your time__

  It's not a race to get voting done. Take your time to really consider each applicant. 
  
### Applying to be a mod thread

* __Do not give members application advice__

   We want to see what people have to say about themselves, not what other people have advised them to say.
