# Staff Guidelines

These guidelines apply to all minecraftforum.net staff members.

## Moderation

### General

* __No tablet/mobile moderation__

  Never moderate from a phone/tablet device. Not only are infractions issued incorrectly when using a mobile device,
but general moderation is trickier and errors far more frequent. Only moderate from a desktop or laptop computer.

### Tools

* __Locking__

  Threads should be locked if the thread itself is redundant or irrelevant. EG: repeated suggestions, content
that could be posted within pinned threads or topics that have been bumped and are no longer relevant. Unless a
thread is a couple of topic pages buried, or is old, you should always leave a lock message.

* __Moving__

  Always make sure that "Leave a link to the new topic in the source forum?" is checked when moving a thread to
a different category. This ensures members can easily find their post.

* __Editing__

  When editing a post do not ever tick the "Show 'edit by' line" box, "Reason for edit" messages should always
  remain private between staff and not be displayed publicly with posts. Moderators are welcome to edit posts
  to fix minor problems (for example formatting issues) however announcing this to other users is not allowed
  as it can derail discussion when people pick up on it and makes the forum look messy. 
  
  If you're editing out a rule break and the post needs to be infracted, make sure that you infract the post 
  before making the edit - that way you'll store the original post within the infraction details.

* __Hiding__

  If a thread or post is breaking a rule, it should be hidden. Hidden threads/posts should almost always be
  infracted/informalled. If you've hidden a post, any subsequent replies to or quotes of the rule breaking post
  should also be hidden, however they should only be infracted/informalled if they have broken a rule.
  Feel free to ask an admin if you are unsure whether to hide/infract a post.

* __Infracting__

  Members with no previous infractions/informals should always receive an informal warning unless their first
rule break is worth 2 points or more.

  Do not add smileys within infraction messages. Infractions exist as a formal warning and/or informal reminder of the
rules. Including smileys within infraction notices only serves to dilute the importance of the message.

  Content that is no longer current should not be infracted. Rule breaking posts which are over 3 months old may still
be edited or hidden where necessary however please do not issue an informal/infraction.

  *Please note:* There are currently a couple of bugs with the infraction system:
  
  - Members who receive 2 infraction points or more are often suspended for longer than they should be. On top of this,
informal warnings applied to an account with 2 or more existing points tend to wrongly trigger posting suspensions.
In the event of this, please alert an admin in [IRC](#irc) to fix the suspension. If you receive no response within
30 minutes, please head to the
[Suspension Request Thread](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1484957-suspension-request-thread/).
  
  - Infraction points don't always expire a month after the issuing date. In this case, please alert an admin
in [IRC](#irc) to expire the infraction point(s). If you receive no response within 30 minutes, please head to the:
[General Request Thread](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/300102-general-request-thread/).

  Along with reporting an erroneous suspension, it's good practice to correct the suspension date at the bottom
  of the infraction private message. Amending this date is helpful in avoiding unnecessary explainations at a
  later date. For example, in the case of a 7 day suspension issued on the 20th of May being inaccurately processed
  as a 10 day suspension, change:

  *You will be unable to post until May 30, 2013 5:46 AM UTC+0.*
  
  to
  
  *You will be unable to post until May 27, 2013 5:46 AM UTC+0.*

### Specific

* __Check infraction history and don't stack informal warnings__

  Before issuing an informal/infraction, you should always check a members infraction history. If a member has 1
or more prior informals, it's time to give them a formal infraction. Informals exist both to remind members of the
rules and to informally warn for light rule breaks. Piling up informals suggests that it's possible to continue
breaking the rules without consequence.

* __Dealing with profanity__

  If a post contains profanity, acronyms included, the word(s) should be edited out. If the profanity coincides 
with any flaming or other rule breaking, please remove the post and infract as normal.

* __Detecting malware__

  If you come across a file or linked site that you suspect may be malicious, please scan it using either
[VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/en-gb/) or [Anubis](http://anubis.iseclab.org/) then report both the
suspected thread/post and malware scan to [IRC](#irc).

* __Misplaced server threads should be hidden__

  If a server thread is posted outside of the PC servers section, do not move it into servers. Hide the thread and
infract for "Server thread (wrong section)". If it's a first offense, informal.

* __Do not move threads into "Minecraft Server Hosting"__

  Minecraft server host threads are carefully vetted before being moved into the "Minecraft Server Hosting" section.
As such, do not move hosting threads into this category. If the thread is not a duplicate, move it to "Other Hosts".

* __Do not move threads into any of the "Tutorials and FAQs" sections__

  Tutorials and FAQ threads are carefully vetted before being moved into one of the "Tutorials and FAQs" sections.
As such, do not move these types of threads into any of the Tutorials and FAQs sections. If the thread is not a
duplicate, move it to "Contact Forum Administration".

## Sectional Moderation

### Minecraft Discussion

* __Server Threads__

  Hide and infract users for advertising server threads outside of the server section.  If the user is reletevely
new (i.e < 10 posts) and has never recieved an infraction before, you can just give an informal; otherwise give
a full infraction.  However, if a user has made a thread looking to join a server, move that thread to the Looking
For section.
 
* __Redundant Suggestions__

  Lock and provide a link to the previous topic in the lock message.  Utilize the "Common Suggestions" thread
that is pinned in the Suggestion section to find the links.

* __Video Replies in News Section__

  Per Sacheverell's request, please remove all video replies to News section threads

### Mapping and Modding

* __Images and Videos__

  If a topic does not have images or videos embedded, but does have them linked in the topic, edit the post and embed them for them.
  If a topic does not have images or videos at all, then informal them reminding them of that, and leave the topic for them to fix. 
  If they do not have it fixed within a day or two, hide the topic.
  
* __Mod / Mod devs clashes__

  If 2 or more mods or mod makers are clashing/arguing with each other, contact the Forum Admin and inform him of it.
  Such situations usually require the admin to get involved to have it resolved.
  
* __Exe files__

  Exe only downloads are not allowed except in the Tools section. If there are any exe only downloads, remove the topic and informal the user.
  Exes are also the most common way to distribute malware, so be sure to get those files scanned. 

* __Malware and Scans__

  If you come across a suspicious file, please get it scanned. 
  If you need to hide the topic for a little bit to avoid users from running it, please do.
  The most common scan sites we use are [Virustotal](http://virustotal.com) and [Anubis](http://anubis.iseclab.org/).
  Malware is a perm-ban and should be reported in #forum using the [Pinging an admin](#pinging-an-admin) template for malware.
  Lastlogin stealers and backdoor plugin or mods are not a perm-ban on the first offense, so use the Malware warn template.
  On the second offense, follow the [Pinging an admin](#pinging-an-admin) Malware template to have the account banned.
  
* __Mod Sites__
 
  Sites that redistribute mods, whether by rehosting the files or by linking the original topic or download links, are not allowed.
  Such sites are not permitted and should be warned for advertising.
  
* __Outdated Mods__

  Where there is a new update made to Minecraft, we use the build that it is, so 1.1,1.2, 1.3, 1.4, not 1.2.5, 1.3, 1.3.2.
  If a mod is 3 builds behind (so like 1.1 when 1.4 is released) then lock the thread and PM the thread owner that their thread was 
  locked and that they can have it unlocked if they want to update the mod.
  If a mod is 2 builds behind, do not lock it for now. Because the update is soon, any mod not updated will not update to the current build and just wait for the next version. Just leave those.
  Simply put, any mod before 1.2 can be lock IF someone posts on it asking for updates to it. Mods for 1.2 and up are not to be locked unless the OP requests it. 
  
* __Stolen Content__

  This is not a simple look at a thread thing. If someone claims the work is stolen, and provides a link to the content 
  it may have been stolen from, then you need to investigate. This means you download it and you look at everything. 
  Texture packs, look at all the files, mods, read the code, maps, open the maps in Minecraft or something, mods, 
  decompile it, read the code, see if it is the same. Don't assume. If the content is the same, then warn for that. 
  If the content is modified, then make sure the original does have a copyright that does say that they can do that.
  
* __SMP Hacks and Cheats__

  The entire topic about this is here: [Regarding SMP "cheats" -- An updated policy](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1561678-)
  
  SMP Hacks and cheats are allowed, however any designed for griefing are not allowed.

### MCX360, MCPE and Other Platforms

* __Lock "When's the new update?" threads__

  Any threads regarding when updates are coming out should be locked for redundancy. Feel free to add a link to the
appropriate pinned thread.

* __Forward on messages from Mojang/Microsoft/4J Studios__

  Do not reply to any messages you receive from parties involved with Minecraft such as Mojang, Microsoft or 4J Studios.
Add citricsquid to the conversation instead allowing him to deal with it in an appropriate manner.

* __Suggestion sections__

  - **Wishlists**

  Members who post suggestion threads with the sole purpose of gathering ideas and suggestions from other members
should have their threads locked for encouraging wishlisting.

  *Example lock message:*
  
  "Please do not post more than one suggestion per thread. Very closely related suggestions are fine, but separate
suggestions require separate threads. Wishlists will be closed or deleted."

  - **Small suggestions**

  A small suggestion is defined as an idea that tweaks or changes an existing Minecraft: Edition feature in some way.
Small suggestion threads should be locked and pointed to the respective
[Xbox 360 small suggestions thread](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1690852-) or
[Pocket Edition small suggestions thread](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1690834-).

  *Example lock message:*
  
  "As your suggestion is a small one, regarding a change to an existing Minecraft feature, please use the 
[Small Xbox 360 Edition Suggestions thread](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1690852-)."

  - **Vague suggestions**

  Similarly, topics which are vague, lacking detail and offer little to no discussion should be locked. Again,
if the idea is small one, please link to the appropriate small suggestions thread.

  *Example lock message:*
  
  "Please ensure your suggestions are clear, concise and fleshed out. Topics which are vague and/or lacking detail
will be locked. If your suggestion is a small one, please use the 
[Small Suggestions thread](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/654104-)."

  - **Redundancy**

  If a suggestion/idea covers exactly the same subject as a previous suggestion thread - and isn't significantly
different in detail - please lock the thread and reply with both the lock reason and a
[link to an existing relevant, active topic](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1665843-).

  *Example lock message:*
  
  "This idea has been suggested before [here]. Please do not post redundant threads. Always browse the current threads
in the forum and use the forums "Search" function at the top of the page before posting. Replying to older threads to
continue discussion and share ideas is acceptable."

* __Multiplayer sections__

  - **Misplaced server, session and minigame threads**
  
  If a server, session or mini-game thread is posted outside of the Multiplayer section, please remove the thread
and, if it's a first offense, informal with the reason: "server thread wrong section". If it's their second, go
ahead and formally warn.

  - **Misplaced "Looking For / Build Help" and clan threads**

  If a "Looking For / Build Help" or clan thread is posted outside of the Multiplayer section, providing the thread
is not a duplicate, move the thread to the appropriate Multiplayer section.

  - **Misplaced threads within the Multiplayer section**

  If a server, session or mini-game thread is posted in the wrong section within the Multiplayer section, move it
to the right category. If the thread is a duplicate, hide as normal.

* __Xbox 360: modification threads__

  Threads regarding the modification of Xbox 360 whether they be map downloads, tools for modification etc.
should be hidden and result in a one point infraction (Informal on first offence) given to the offending user.
Please use the infraction reason: "Modification (MCX360)".

* __Xbox 360: glitching is not allowed__

  Any threads detailing how to perform any duplication glitches within Minecraft: Xbox Edition should be hidden
and the user should receive an informal infraction notifying them that such posts aren't accepted.

* __Xbox 360: Help and Support__

  Please move the following threads to the Xbox 360
[Help and Support section](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forum/230-mcx360-help-support/):
  - Interface issues
  - Technical questions
  - Video recording questions

  The exception to this rule is bug report threads. These, if confirmed, should generally be locked and pointed to
the [Known bugs list thread](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1679404-) as normal.

* __Xbox 360: Seeds__

  To avoid many, many locked/removed seeds threads within the Xbox 360 seeds sections, moderators are permitted to
add the title update version tag. eg: [TU8], to the titles of threads that have are missing the title formatting.

  Please be sure you're confident about the version the members seed thread is related to.

* __Pocket Edition: Mapping and Modding__

  The [root of Mapping and Modding](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forum/229-mcpe-mapping-and-modding/) is free for all
MCPE: M&M threads which don't fit into either the maps, texture packs or mods / tools sections.

  Examples of threads that can exist in the MCPE M&M root:
  - Mod/tools discussion / creation / support threads.
  - Texture pack discussion / creation / support threads.
  - Map discussion discussion / creation / support threads.
  - MCPE M&M related tutorials.
  - Anything else MCPE M&M related that isn't specifically a mod, tool, texture pack or map.

  Exceptions:

  Compliment threads referring to an existing M&M thread in one of the sub-sections should be locked and pointed to
the original mod/tool/map/texture pack thread.

* __Pocket Edition: Texture packs require the authors permission__

  Threads posted within the MCPE: Texture Packs section must include permission from the original artist if
porting a PC texture pack created by another user. If a member does not have permission you should give the user
an infraction for "Stolen Content (MCPE)".

### Servers

* __Keep up to date with watchlist__

  Occasionally a server may wind up being so rule-breaking they end up on our 
  [master watchlist](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1169302-). Any server that ends up on there has shown 
  total disregard of our rules, and are not allowed, or have strict rules. Please keep up to date with this 
  list and watch for them.
  
* __Avoid posting in Minecraft Server Hosting__

  Hosts are a competive group, and mods posting in the section supporting a specific host causes issues 
  with them claiming bias. To avoid this, we prefer you either us a different account or avoid posting 
  there altogether.

* __Reports are not always right__

  Just because it gets reported does not mean that the post is wrong. This is a common issue with hosts 
  as some report anything and everything to try to punish hosts for things they really are not doing wrong.
  Do not assume that a report is right. Read the post. Read the context. Then decide for yourself if it is
  wrong or not.

* __Doubleposting is not always bumping__ 

  What this means is that just because a person posts twice in a row does not mean that it is wrong, nor
  should they be punished for that. Double-posting where the posts are to be hidden and warned are for 
  things like posting review replies one at a time. It is not their fault someone did not reply. If they 
  have something to add about their host or server, then use your discretion to determine if it is a worthy update.

* __Support posts are not allowed__ 

  Pretty simple, posts related to support, whether the site, their server, or how to do something involving 
  their server, is not allowed. Simply hide the post and informal them telling them support-related posts 
  are not allowed on the host threads.

* __Replies in Hosting Requests need something besides a copy-paste__ 

  What we mean is the use of copy-paste is not allowed at all. Replies to requests must be specific to that 
  thread's needs, if a host replies and does not meet the needs but tries to offer their services, this is not 
  allowed. Example, if someone wants a tekkit host, repliers must be able to offer tekkit hosting. Another thing
  is that replies that state "I have PM'ed you" or worded that way are not allowed. There is no reason to tell 
  them that, and serves no purpose to the thread. Those are to be hidden and the poster informaled about it.

* __Minecraft Server Hosting is restricted__ 
 
  This section is specific and hosts must apply to get into this section. As a part of the application,
  they must agree to an agreement that any mod should read before moderating in this specific section. 
  The agreement may be found here. This agreement is very specific and does mention any violation of the 
  rules will result in their termination. If a host is breaking rules, please inform one of the admins about 
  it so that it can be looked at and determined if their agreement has been broken and if termination of their 
  thread is needed. We have been a bit lienent on this, but this will change.

* __Hosts that advertise must offer Minecraft server hosting__
  
  Hosts that wish to advertise in this section must offer some sort of Minecraft server hosting.
  VPSes/dedis do count as long as they are comparing them to use for servers, just regular VPS/dedi
  advertising is not allowed. If it becomes a problem, we will remove that part and only allow hosts to
  advertise that offer server hosting with VPS/dedis not counting. If a host does offer server hosting, 
  they may offer their other services in their thread as well, for example webhosting or VPSes.

* __Hosting Requests is not for looking for staff__

  Hosts may not use the Hosting Request section to look for new staff members, nor may they create a new 
  thread in the Other Hosts section with this purpose. If they wish to look for new staff, they can either 
  post this on their existing thread, or post a new thread in the Looking For section. Both of those are fine.

* __Giveaways__

  Hosts are permitted to offer giveaways, however there are restictions on this. They are not allowed to use 
  their thread as an application collection point, nor make a new thread about their giveaway. They may post 
  about their giveaway on their thread, but any applications must be sent either via PM or though an external 
  source. They cannot use their thread to collect applications.

* __Hosts must abide by any license or legal information__

  This is not really worded well, but hosts must use legalized software on any part of their site. Examples of 
  the most common illegal software is nulled WHMCS. If hosts use illegal software, then remove their thread and 
  warn them that using illegal software is not allowed and that they are not permitted to advertise their site 
  while they use such software. You can use this to see if they are using a valid copy of the WHMCS software.

* __Do not lock host threads__

  This is important. Do not lock any host thread, whether in the Other Hosts or the Minecraft Server Hosting 
  section without prior permission by an admin. Threads may be locked without an admin's permission if the 
  host requests it.

### Support

### Show Your Creation

* __Server threads__

    Hide and infract users for advertising server threads outside of the server section. If the user is reletevely 
new (i.e < 10 posts) and has never recieved an infraction before, you can just give an informal; otherwise give 
a full infraction. However, if a user has made a thread looking to join a server, move that thread to the Looking 
For section. If the user is looking for others to make a video with, and asks for a server alongside this, move it to
Video/Series Help.

* __Bumping__

    If a user is bumping their video, livestream or artwork with an update such as new chapter for their story, announcing
 that their livestream is live again or  sharing a new video, leave the post as it is. If the user adds information such
 as "I'll make a new video tomorrow" or simply states "bump", remove and give an infraction for bumping. If it is their
 first offense, feel free to give an informal infraction.

* __Channel linking__

    If a user simply links to their YouTube channel or a YouTube playlist, remove the thread and give an informal infraction
 for channel linking. If the user has done this more than once, give a formal infraction using the "other" category.
 
* __Videos not embedding__

    If a user has managed to break the autoembedder, check the code in their post by using the edit button. If the link uses
 https:// the video will not embed. Simply remove the s to make the link http:// to embed the video. Send the user a 
 message to inform them of why the embed did not work. Do not remove the thread and do not give an infraction.
 
* __Duplicate threads__
 
    If a user is posting their threads across multiple sections, warn them for duplicate threads. If their thread could fit 
in multiple sections, tell them to pick the one they feel is most relevant.

* __Griefing threads__

    Whether the thread is recruiting for griefers, or sharing videos or screenshots of the griefing, warn the user and hide
 the thread. They usually lead to flaming. 
 
* __Herobrine threads__

    If the thread clearly states that Herobrine doesn't exist, and that the creation is simply fan art, leave the thread
 and do not infract for it.
 
* __Other games videos__

    If a user posts a Terraria video thread, lock the topic and redirect the user to the 
[Terraria Forums](http://www.terrariaonline.com/forum/). If a user posts a Cobalt video thread, lock the topic and redirect
 the user to the [Cobalt Forums](http://www.cobaltforum.net/forum)

### Off Topic

* __Minecraft related content__

    Move all Minecraft related threads to their appropriate forum. Do not hide, lock, or send an infraction unless they
  are also spamming, trolling, or breaking any other rule in addition to posting in the wrong section.
  
* __Selling, trading, and begging__

    Hide and infract users for trading or selling accounts, games, or any other product. This includes requests for
  products and begging. Do not hide posts or infract users who are simply giving out game codes for free unless they
  are running a contest, using referral links, or otherwise advertising.
    
* __Video related threads__

    Lock all video related discussion threads and redirect the user to the
  [Video Receptacle Thread](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1664815-video-receptacle-thread/). Do not infract the user
  unless they repeatedly make video related threads.

* __Forum game and roleplaying disruption__

    Hide posts which disrupt forum game and roleplaying threads. If it's the first offense, send the user an informal warning.
  Otherwise, send them an infraction.
  
* __OS / browser / console wars__

    Lock all OS vs OS, browser vs browser, and console vs console threads. Hide and infract users who steer topics into
  an OS / browser / console war. Do not hide or infract for posts that include comparisons but do not actually turn
  the topic into a war.

## IRC

Being on IRC is mandatory while moderating. This is to allow staff members to communicate quickly and efficiently
with one another in case any issues arrise.

__Ask in IRC before heading to the forums__

  If you have any questions or requests, always ask within IRC first. There are many helpful staff members lurking
who are ready and able to help answer any queries you may have.

### IRC Basics

* __Register your nickname__

Your nickname is for you. By registering yor nickname, you can claim that name on the Esper network so that only you 
can use it. To register your nick, use the following command:
/msg nickserv register password email
Follow the directions that NickServ will send you to complete the registeration.

To identify (log in) to your nick, join IRC with that nick and use the following command:
/msg nickserv identify password

If your nickname is in use by someone else and you have already registered it, you can use this command to kick that user
off the Esper network so you can then use it:
/msg nickserv ghost nick password

* __Voice and Op__

Voice is similar to that of moderator on a forum. On IRC, voice only shows your name above others in the user list.
In the #minecraftforums channel, voiced users usually are also able to kick.
In the #forum and #minecraftforums channel, voice represent the moderators for Minecraftforum.

Op is similar to that of admin on a forum. Ops are able to kick and ban users, along with voicing and oping others.
In the #forum and #minecraftforums channel, op represent the admins for Minecraftforum.

### Mandatory channels

* __#forum__
  
  To be used for general moderation questions, suspension adjustments, ip checks, avatar and signature
removals, spambots, malware and misused alt accounts.

* __#mcf_(section)__
  
  Your section specific IRC channel. EG: #mcf_md, #mcf_mnm, #mcf_platforum #mcf_servers, #mcf_support, #mcf_syc, #mcf_ot

### Optional channels

* __#fofftopic__ An offtopic chat channel for the entire staff group.

* __#minecraftforums__ The Minecraft Forum support channel.

### Pinging an admin

If you require the attention of an admin within #forum, please use the following pings:

* __Suspension: (amount) (member)__

  EG: Suspension: 7 days http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/424279-d3fin3d/

* __Malware: (post) (scan if one has been done)__

  EG: Malware: http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1384861- https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/23200dd58f8b2b225999eb1107d87e173540ad965e913ed2c3e2d9e235fe13d7/analysis/

* __Spambot: (post)__

  EG: Spambot: http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1384861-

* __Alt: (members) (type) [thread]__

  EG: Alt: http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/424279-d3fin3d/ Main: http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/424279-d3fin3d/
Misrepresentation http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1384861-

* __Admin: (type) (link)__

  Used for all other requests:

  EG: Admin: NSFW avatar: http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/424279-d3fin3d/
  
  EG: Admin: Profanity within signature: http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/424279-d3fin3d/
  
  EG: Admin: Infraction didn't expire: http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/424279-d3fin3d/

### If no admins are available

If you do not get a response from an admin within 30 minutes, please report to either:

* __Spambot removals__ http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/329156-how-to-deal-with-spammers-report-spammers-here/
* __General requests__ http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/300102-general-request-thread/
* __Suspension requests__ http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1484957-suspension-request-thread/

### IRC clients

It's highly beneficial to use an IRC client to connect to our various channels. Webchat, although convenient at times,
is browser reliant with very minimal customisation and poor multi-channel support. Here is a list of popular IRC
clients:

* [__mIRC__](http://www.mirc.com/)

* [__IceChat__](http://www.icechat.net/site/)

* [__XChat SE__](http://xchat.servx.ru/)

* [__HydraIRC__](http://www.hydrairc.com/)

* [__Quassel__](http://quassel-irc.org/)

## Etiquette

As a Minecraft Forum staff member it's important to note that, besides helping to keep things running
smoothly, there are some fundamental points of etiquette that need to be followed:

* __Never leak information__

  All communication within staff IRC channels, the Administrator & Moderator section, Apparatus, infraction PM's
and all other staff orientated interaction is considered private and confidential. Do not, under any
circumstances, divulge any of this material to anyone beyond the staff group.

* __Don't break the rules__

  As a staff member, you are governed by exactly the same set of rules as everyone else. You are expected to
follow the rules very closely, setting a good example to other members. This includes ensuring all your content
and replies are suitable for a family friendly environment.

* __Contain the IRC/A&M madness__

  There's a lot of frivolous fun and mayhem within the staff group. Many staff members use these areas to let
their proverbial hair down and go wild. It's important to remember that this craziness shouldn't extend beyond
the boundaries of the inner staff walls. Keep your public persona sane and on point.

* __Be polite and courteous__

  You are a representative of MCF. Please bear this in mind when engaging with other members. A few basic
pleasantries can go a long, long way. Make sure that you include "please" and "thank you" in the appropriate
places and remain polite at all times. However, check that you're not being overly nice or smiley in the wrong
places, as this could be interpreted as sarcasm, ridicule or arrogance.

* __Don't abuse or brag about your position__

  Please use the tools you have been given wisely. If you disagree with an opinion or dislike posted material that
is fully within the MCF rules, do not edit it out or hide the post. Moderative action for personal gain is
strictly forbidden. Never use your position as leverage over other members. Being part of the Minecraft Forum
staff can be exciting, but please don't go out of your way to brag about it.

* __Avoid argumentative behaviour__

  Participating in heated debates while carrying the staff tag can feel threatening and unfair to other members
of the forum. While logged in as staff, please avoid conflicts, confrontation and expressing aggressive opinions.
If you really want to passionately discuss something, please use an alternate account.

* __Personal opinion is not always fact__

  Within all your content, always check that you're not stating an opinion as fact. What you write can be viewed
as gospel by the rest of the forum. If you're expressing an opinion, please use: "I believe", "personally" and
"in my opinion". Make sure that, unless 100% certain, you're not stating a personal belief as the whole truth.
If ever in doubt, always ask before making "official" sounding statements.

* __Moderate objectively__

  You should never moderate content that you are directly affiliated with. This includes: Your own topics, threads
of servers that you admin/moderate/help out with, infraction disputes and replies to your posts. If there's any
hint of a conflict of interest, please either report the rule break or refer the task to a fellow staff member.

* __Don't flame Mojang or their partners__

  Mojang and co. are the reason we're here. They publically consider minecraftforum.net the "official" forums and have
given us, an external website, the responsibility of being the primary location for all Minecraft related discussion.
Therefore, by association, your position will be considered affiliated with Mojang and co. As such, do not flame
Mojang, their partners, their employees, their products or their actions. Feel free to offer your balanced opinion,
but if you feel a burning desire to express criticism, contempt or insult towards Minecraft's creators, please use an
account that's not connected to the MCF staff group.

* __Behave well everywhere else too__

  Your Minecraft Forum details will probably connect to other accounts, websites and in-game names around the
interweb. Please take this into consideration when conducting yourself online. Your MCF representation extends
to all other environments that share the same details. If you wish to be riské elsewhere, use an alias or
alternate account.


Please ensure that everything you do fits within these etiquette guidelines. We take staff misbehaviour very
seriously, especially considering the public representative position that staff members have been given.

## Apparatus

As a Minecraft Forums staff member you are encouraged to look through, comment and vote on moderator applications.
Please [log into Apparatus](http://apparatus.mcf.li/) using your existing MCF login details.

There are a number of things to keep in mind when voting and commenting on moderator applications. Please bear the
following points in mind as they really help us out when deciding on potential new staff members.

* __Voting__

  Voting no means you think they would not make a good moderator in any section. If you think they would be a good
candidate but for a section other than your own, please vote yes and explain that in the comments.

* __Commenting__

  If you vote yes or no, please explain your reasons in the comments. Sometimes it's blindingly obvious of course,
but it isn't always. You might know more than others about a certain user. We want to know the reasons you think
they'd be a good or bad moderator, otherwise your vote doesn't tell us much other than your personal opinion

* __Posting is not activity__

  Just because a member does not post on a regular basis does not mean that they don't log in. If a user isn't
posting often, they may be regulating their own post quality. Remember, we want quality over quantity. I'd rather
a user didn't post than posted crap on every thread they visit.

* __Lacking posts in certain sections__

  A user doesn't necessarily have to post in the sections they are applying for. Just because they don't post in
the section does not mean that they don't visit often. They may not have their own original content/ideas for
the section, or may feel they do not need to add to discussion. This isn't to say that they do not enjoy browsing
the section and consuming the content.

* __Post count__

  Post count means absolutely nothing. If a member has 5 extremely helpful posts, it's far better than a member
with 500 useless posts.

* __Don't just go with the crowd__

  Take your time to read through each application and make your own decision. Don't just vote as other's are voting.
Don't feel you need to vote the same way as others, but explain the reasons why you agree or disagree with others.

* __Don't compare users__

  Don't compare apps as though we have a limit. If someone would make a good moderator we should hire them
regardless. "I've seen better" is not a valid reason to deny someone the moderator position. We aren't hiring for
just one moderator, we need lots. If we used this reason, we'd only have one moderator.

* __You can skip applications!__

  If you aren't sure simply don't vote. Don't feel you have to vote if you are undecided.

* __Don't obsess over small issues__

  Things like "they put more effort into this part of the application than this part which I find more important"
is not a reason to vote no. You should be considering the member as a whole, not just voting no because he did one
little thing you don't like.

* __Take your time__

  It's not a race to get voting done. Take your time to really consider each applicant. 
  
### Applying to be a mod thread

* __Do not give members application advice__

   Please do not give moderator applicants any sort of advice or guidance. We want to see what people have to say about
   themselves, not what other people have advised them to say.
